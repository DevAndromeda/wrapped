Welcome!

### Getting started

- Ensure you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed
- Clone the project
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run the app at **localhost:3000/**
- With the Vercel CLI, run `vercel env pull` to get the environment variables. Otherwise, manually add a **.env** and find the variables in Slack.
- Sign in from the browser

That's it. Changes to components should hot-reload in the browser.

Let me know if you have any questions!
